*Martin Fowlerâ€™s* guide to reworking bad code into well-structured code

**Refactoring** improves the design of existing code and enhances software maintainability, as well as making existing code easier to understand. Original Agile Manifesto signer and software development thought leader, *Martin Fowler*, provides a catalog of refactorings that explains why you should refactor; how to recognize code that needs refactoring; and how to actually do it successfully, no matter what language you use.
